The github portal for all the things I intend to do with respect to

[W7BRS Stuff](http://blog.w7brs.com)


- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on the rocket engine controllers for lunar descent at Blue Origin.
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning SDR fundamentals, and building tube based audio gear to make my radio signal bit more de-lux.
- ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on SDR stuff and ways to teach CW to those who are timid.
- ðŸ¤” Iâ€™m looking for help with getting this SDR stuff going.  Notice a pattern?
- ðŸ’¬ Ask me about Unix, Embedded Software, bare metal programming.
- ðŸ“« How to reach me: on QRZ... W7BRS
- âš¡ Fun fact: I can be bribed with cookies.
